Data-TreeDraw version 0.0.2

While there are a number of great programs out there for Dumping and visualising heavily nested data structures these can
often be over-whelming and hard to read. Additionally, often in order to access a particular data entry you often
have to back-trace over a Dumped structure to find the specific code appropriate to dereference that particular
value. This module aims to address these issues and several others by providing number of different features with a
very simple interface that is particularly aimed at helping to visualise data-rich heavily-nested structures - see
OVERVIEW. 

This module exports a single sub-routine call C<draw>. Simply call this routine with the data structure you wish to
print along with a HASH reference of any options you wish to pass - see OPTIONS and OVERVIEW.
